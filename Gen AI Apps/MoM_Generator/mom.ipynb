      "üïí Chunk 1: If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed. If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small, since a pride, and it will encourage you to do another task, and another, and another. And by the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. And your bed will also reinforce the fact.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 2: that the little things in life matter. If you can't do the little things right, you'll never be able to do the big things right. And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made. That you made, and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better. I've been a Navy SEAL for 36 years. Every morning in SEAL training, mine structures, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would show up in my barracks.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 3: room and the first thing they do is inspect my bed. If you did it right the corners would be square, the covers would be pulled tight, the pillow center just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack. It was a simple task, mundane at best, but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection. It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle and Blech, and beasts, and high powered ceilers.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 4: But the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over. It matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform. It matters not your gender, your ethnic or religious background, your orientation or your social status. Our struggles in this world are similar, and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward, changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 5: If you think it's hard to change the lives of 10 people, change their lives forever, you're wrong. I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan, but changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it. So what starts here can indeed change the world. You will likely fail often, and it will be painful. It will be discouraging. At times it will test you to your very core.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 6: At that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm. When you must be calm, when you must be composed, when all your tactical skills, your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear. If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moments. If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world...\n",
      "üïí Chunk 7: It is the power of hope, the power of one person, a Washington, a Lincoln, King Mandela, and even a young girl from Pakistan, Malala. One person can change the world by giving people hope. Start each day with a task completed. Find someone to help you through life, respect everyone. Know that life is not fair and that you will fail often. But if you take some risks, step up when the times are the toughest. Face down the point.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 8: Lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up. If you do these things, the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today. And what's started here will indeed have changed the world for the better. Finally in Seal Training there's a bell, a brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see. All you have to do to quit is ring the bell.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 9: Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at five o'clock ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the PT and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training All you have to do is ring the bell to get out If you want to change the world\n",

So that is the reason the back of the logo is considered water. So let you see the creation of the logo here.\n",

It was a very beautiful piece of artwork that you presented to us earlier, and it is exactly the spirit that we...\n",

And those confluence of the two rivers created such a great city. And we live in such an amazing city and we're all proud of it and sometimes we, and a lot of people from all over the country are out of the world are proud of it. And sometimes a little too proud of it.\n",

      "üïí Chunk 18: or disrespect. I think of a quote that Sysau Chavez made very popular. And it stuck with me for a very long time. And any time I have the opportunity, I speak in front of children, especially children in our community that they often second guess themselves and where they're coming from, who they are. And I always say that it's very important.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 19: to be proud of who you're from. And the quote that I use from Sissar Chavez is, you know, pride in one's own culture does not require contempt or disrespect of another, right? And that's very important. It's very important for us to recognize that no matter who we are where we come from in this society, that your pride in your own culture doesn't require, should not require, the contempt or disrespect of another. I mean, what a year to be for that to just sit on our shoulders.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 20: for a while for us to think about, right? And so I wanted to just to thank you all, I think the commission, there's gonna be a couple individuals that are gonna come and speak thank you for your art, your lovely artwork for us to see what's in your heart and what now has become, probably is gonna be a very important symbol for the community. And also just for the work, the daily work every single day, we still have a lot of brothers and sisters\n",
      "üïí Chunk 21: and the teachers once lived in these lands freely now stand on street corners, right, in poverty without access to services, right, without access to sobriety or even housing or jobs and what a cruel way to pay back a culture that has paved the way for the city to be built upon its shores, right? So we have a lot of work to do in these kind of proclamations.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 22: in this day is not a day off, it's a day on and then. Right? And addressing those critical issues so. I know that my colleagues are very supportive. I'm going to ask you to support this proclamation. I know you always have done in the past. I'm very proud of today. Oh, and you made Time Magazine in Newsweek once again today. As being a leader in terms of the cities that are celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day, I wanted to make a point out of that.\n",

I don't think I could add much more to what Councilman Lopez has shared with us. I want to thank him for bringing this forward and really just appreciate all the contributions that our Native American community has contributed to this great city and great state. I worked in the Lieutenant-\n",

And for those of you who continue to participate in the annual powwow it's such a great\n",
      "üïí Chunk 25: opportunity for everybody else to enjoy so many of the contributions of the culture. I mean, to see that the dance continues to be carried on as well as the Native language from generation to generation is just so incredible because in so many cultures, you know, people have come here and assimilated to the, you know, the norms here and they lose their language and lose a lot of the...\n",
      "üïí Chunk 26: the culture and in the native community that that hasn't happened that has that you know commitment to just passing that on from generation to generation is is so important and so I'm I'm happy to be a co-sponsor of this tonight. Thank you. All right thank you councilman or take a councilwoman can you. Thank you very much and I also want to thank my colleague for bringing this forward and I just want to.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 27: to say a word to artists about how beautiful and moving I thought this logo was and your description of it. And I think one of the things that is clear is the words sometimes don't convey the power of imagery or music or the other pieces that make up culture. And so I think the art is so important. And when you talked about water, I was also thinking about land. And I guess I just wanted to say thank you. Many of the Native American peoples of Colorado have been at the forefront, actually nationally of different...\n",
      "üïí Chunk 28: some of the public lands that have been protected over the last few years that are under attack right now. And there are places that the communities have fought to protect, but that everyone gets to enjoy. And so I just think that it's an example of where cultural preservation intersects with environmental protection, with recreation and all of the other ways that public lands are so important. And so I think I just wanted to say thank you for that, because I think we have some very safe...\n",
      "üïí Chunk 29: in our country that are at risk right now. And so as we celebrate, I appreciate that there's still a piece of resistance in here. And I think that I just want to mention a solidarity. And I mentioned a feeling of solidarity with that resistance. So thank you. And happy Confluence Week. Thank you, Councilwoman Kanich. And seeing all the comments, I'll just say a couple. And in a time of such devices.\n",
      "üïí Chunk 30: of ugliness and just despicable behavior from our leadership. The reason I'm so supportive of Indigenous people's days because it means inclusivity. It means respecting all, respecting those who have been silenced on purpose for a long time and whose history has not been told. And so we celebrate inclusivity in the face of such evil times, honestly.\n"
